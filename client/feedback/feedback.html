           <p>We have tried our best to develop this app but if you find any issues,
                have some feedback or you want to appreciate the work then
                get in touch.</p>

           <h3>Support us</h3>
           <p>We can certainly do with some more hands on deck and would like to open this opportunity to others. 
               If you can help us with marketing, development, designing, testing or anything relevant 
               then we want to hear from you.</p>
            
            <h3>Help us with Marketing</h3>
           <p>We are really struggling at the moment to engage with the people that like us on facebook or 
               who have subscribed to the newsletter and it would be massive help if somebody could 
                volunteer to lead on that front.
           </p>
               
            <h3>Share with others</h3>
            <p>One thing that determines the future of this app is how much demand there is for it so share 
                with others and leave us reviews</p>
            
            <h3>Missing Features</h3>
            <p>A lot of effort has gone in (probably 70+ hours) to take this app from the concept stage to it's current 
            state but a lot more effort is required to add more features. Here are the list of key features that are 
            missing and we will be looking to add soon (providing there is a demand for this app).</p>
